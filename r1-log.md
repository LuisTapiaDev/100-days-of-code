# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Luis Tapia]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Thursday, 2021].

I'll be following the Full Stack JavaScript path from The Odin Project, and completing the FreeCodeCamp certification projects as well.
Furtheraway I'll be moving on to blockchain development, and any technology that fits my needs.

## Log

### R1D1 [October 14, Thursday, 2021]

Continued with The Odin Project's landing page project, which is sushi themed. Since I did the HTML structure yesterday, today I focused on tuning up the hero section.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1448665927701176322)

### R1D2 [October 15, Friday, 2021]

Sushi landig page initial template finished, but will be further styled tomorrow.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1449156052197552140)

### R1D3 [October 16, Saturday, 2021]

Sushi landing page is completed! Still not responsive for mobile but it will be done later. Moving on to further lessons and projects!

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1449599255325335552)

### R1D4 [October 17, Sunday, 2021]

Now as the [sushi landing page](https://github.com/luisntapia/sushi-landing-page) is done, I'm moving on to the JavaScript section of Foundations. While reading the lessons, I'm working on FreeCodeCamp's tribute page html/css project so I'm actually coding aside from the tutorials.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1449938896373129216)

### R1D5 [October 18, Monday, 2021]

Not great visual changes today, but I'm almost done cloning the FreeCodeCamp's mobile reference page for building the project. Next steps are adapting for desktop and then customizing the content and additional CSS to make it look nicer.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1450324352314920964)

### R1D6 [October 19, Tuesday, 2021]

Tweaked a few things and added media queries for resembling the FreeCodeCamp's example page. Now I'm adding my own content and style, beginning with the Marcus Aurelius image and placeholder text.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1450687018686717953)

### R1D7 [October 20, Wednesday, 2021]

Almost done with the project. Changed the display, colors, and background of the website. Only a few more styles and the timeline/quote content remaining.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1451050264379727873)

### R1D8 [October 21, Thursday, 2021]

The [tribute page](https://github.com/luisntapia/tribute-page) is finally done. It took a while but it's worth the results. Probably React stuff will be added later as I advance with The Odin Project's JavaScript path, but it's fine for now.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1451451941033291808)

### R1D9 [October 23, Saturday, 2021]

I couldn't commit here yesterday. I did try to do it and made the GitHub repo, but was too sleepy to complete the 1-hour daily challenge. Today I'm continuing with the freeCodeCamp's survey form project. The html is already done and passed all the tests. So, tomorrow will be meant to make the project look beautiful.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1452181741175705600)

### R1D10 [October 24, Sunday, 2021]

I made an image background for the form and applied a few media queries to make the webpage responsive. I'm pretty close to finish this one, and mostly what's remaining is styling the fonts and form elements. Will probably personalize the form info later. On the other side, I'm taking steps to get to The Odin Project's JS calculator ASAP, so the fun begins!

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1452539394079006720)

### R1D11 [October 25, Monday, 2021]

Styling form elements isn't as straightforward as I thought but I'm pretty much done with that. It already looks cool, further details would be refining the stuff. CSS has been kinda tricky so far, and some seemingly simple things actually take its time to figure it out. Still looking forward to JS.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1452915046170996739)

### R1D12 [October 26, Tuesday, 2021]

I haven't coded with python after a while, but it's my first programming language -from which I've learned the syntax, at least. I've returned to it today while completing the freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Certification's arithmetic formatter project. Though the time I've been around with it, my knowledge is still within the basic syntax, and the project seems challenging, so I'm happy with it.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1453252621456773127)

### R1D13 [October 27, Wednesday, 2021]

Python program is taking shape. It now prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator. I handles exceptions very well, and displays all the operations results either when it reaches a max of 5 or when the user tells so. Still, it needs to format the results and get input by means of a function, but the core is already there.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1453628397993684994)

### R1D14 [October 28, Thursday, 2021]

I'm working on the arithmetic_arranger function. It does the job: returns an arranged problem. The only minor issue are a few times when the formatter doesn't add an extra space between operator and operand. Still, that needs to be adapted to other project's requites but it's going alright.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1453895043706728449)

### R1D15 [November 01, Monday, 2021]

I continued with the Python arithmetic formatter project, where found the bug it had and fixed it. Most of your development time is actually reading code rather than typing, they say; It's making a whole lot of sense now, even with a simple project.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1455413896055984143)

### R1D16 [November 02, Tuesday, 2021]

Closer to a final app. It arranges the problems correctly. Somehow doesn't pass the freeCodeCamp tests on Replit but I'll figure it out tomorrow. Aside from it, I must clean the code as well. As an advice from tweet reply I received, it would be useful to search about declarative vs imperative programming in order to make my code more readable. Surely will check that later.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1455825514602668034)

### R1D17 [November 03, Wednesday, 2021]

The formatter already works well, but isn't 'pixel perfect' regarding some end-of-the-line spacing and hence fails some of the freeCodeCamp tests. All the time today was taken on debugging.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1456136357525422082)

### R1D18 [November 04, Thursday, 2021]

Yet again, another coding session fully meant for debugging. The error that caused inconsistencies when adding spaces and line breaks to the formatted results was easier than expected, but took time. Then I noticed that the assignment requested as well to return error messages when the list given doesn't accomplish the requisites. This will probably be almost done tomorrow; I need to check further about regular expressions to solve it. As my today python session is now completed, I'll spend the rest of the day with JS lessons.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1456375935469604868)

### R1D19 [November 05, Friday, 2021]

All freeCodeCamp's tests passed in arithmetic arranger. I'll move on to the next project, but will clean code and add UI to this project in the future.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1456872025956524033)

### R1D20 [November 06, Saturday, 2021]

Beginning with freeCodeCamp's time calculator. I was planning about how to handle the project most of the today's time, but now it's ready to be coded!

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1457215176801804288)

### R1D21 [November 07, Sunday, 2021]

At first, the project didn't seem too complex -it isn't eitherways-, but looking at it and figuring out how to do it, it wasn't as straightforward as it seemed. You better off plan it well when coding, so I did it: made a list of smaller tasks that should be done for completing the project: from simple to complex. It worked. Now I'm fairly confident about what I am doing and feels great.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1457429483858927620)

### R1D22 [November 08, Monday, 2021]

Won't be updating on Twitter today because I'm out of internet, but still I coded. I'm adding more functions to the time calculator and started to realize the power it has in making your code more succint. Best of all is that many of these functions I'm creating may come handy in the future, because it's extremely common to manipulate hours and time in many formats all the time.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1458798150852878336)

### R1D23 [November 09, Tuesday, 2021]

Jeez, another day without internet connection. Tomorrow that will be fixed and I will tryhard with coding.

First I solved the FizzBuzz problem and decomposed it in a variety of reusable JS functions- Don't know if an overkill for the particular problem since it could be solved with less lines of code (the functions were _really_ simple anyways), but it made me understand how handy can be to have different functions that do specific thing in the program. Probably as the program scales those specific functions may fit for different related tasks and avoid repeating code.

Then, I continued with the Python time calculator. Coincidentally I was reading today from The Odin Project Curriculum that problem solving skills are planning are crucial, even more importat than coding itself. This denmonstrated to be true today as I felt lost when trying to figure out what to do next in the code. Even though I already made a plan after begging with the project, it wasn't too specific, and many of the 'little chuncks' I was solving weren't as simple as I thought. So, pseudocoding would be useful, and that's what I'll be doing tomorrow.

P.S. Soon the next JS project (rock paper scissors) will be developed.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1458799496809357316)

### R1D24 [November 11, Thursday, 2021]

Before completing different lessons from The Odin Projcet curriculum I began with the Rock Paper Scissors JavaScript project. It's console-based and only made up of functions, but it's proving to be good practice. It's mostly done, but since it's late I will finish it between tomorrow and the day after it. Same as before, problem solving and planning of the solution is taking importance and I'm planning to sharpen that skill with CodeWars, from which I did a kata today and enjoyed it.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1459052349947666435)

### R1D25 [November 21, Sunday, 2021]

Really. Really won't be missing days anymore. I've been following through The Odin Project's curriculum and solved the exercises. They were simple but quite challenging at the same time. After that, I was required to install Node.js in order to run TDD for other practice exercises. It was successfully installed, but the exercises will be done tomorrow as it's too late right now.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1462681722529611781s)

### R1D26 [November 23, Tuesday, 2021]

Pseudocode turns out to be _really_ useful. Just comment it out and makes your life easier. I'm working through TheOdinProject's javascript-exercises repository exercises.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1463399828277415936)

### R1D27 [November 24, Wednesday, 2021]

I'ma talk about two things: what I did today, and my recent Platzi subscription purchase and what it relates to this.

I'm excited to be near to the final lessons of The Odin Project's Foundations course. I've enjoyed it so far and want to learn React soon. Today I completed some JavaScript exercises and heading on to the DOM manipulation topic.

In addition to The Odin Project, I'll be taking Platzi courses to complement. Both for web and blockchain development, and many other topics, it has a very attractive value proposition. I'd love to learn blockchain development in the near future after frontend at TOP and hope these courses turn out well.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1463694561113427974)

### R1D28 [December 11, Saturday, 2021]

Getting up to speed with DOM manipulation, starting with a rock paper scissors. Most of the JavaScript logic was made today. Next day will be completed and have CSS added.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1469909479609225220)

### R1D29 [December 17, Friday, 2021]

I'm back yet again, and taking a frontend Platzi course to help me out building a nice using interface for The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors. As a challenge from that course was to try to build a Google homepage, and as I've already done it from a former TOP project, I decided to take Duck Duck Go as the challenge instead.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1472011381046140928)

### R1D30 [December 22, Wednesday, 2021]

I'm liking the Platzi courses and this project is proof of that. Taking a break from The Odin Project curriculum but I think following video courses can get me a chance to watch the teachers apply best practices of code. This one (practical JavaScript course) has presented several math applications in a website which could be useful for later projects. Probably will follow along the practical frontend developer course next and make the UI prettier.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1473914224233443334)

### R1D31 [December 23, Thursday, 2021]

Following along the Platzi's practical JavaScript course, I made a function to calculate a number array's median, but the class' challenge was to sort the given array. This couldn't be done with the .sort() method only using one parameter because numbers are converted to strings. I made a workaround (with many lines of code) to make it work just fine but then realized I just had to read the docs that the class refered to as it could be made much simplier with only some additional parameters. At least I practiced coding after all.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1474308574968963081)

### R1D32 [December 25, Saturday, 2021]

Starting with The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1475049893957812224)

### R1D33 [December 26, Sunday, 2021]

Struggling with the Etch-a-Sketch project but enjoying the challenge. First it was the CSS styles from the canvas tag childs that didn't load when the class was added through JavaScript, and then the square divs appear as a black screen. Looking forward to keep on engineering the project tomorrow.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1475306214707838980)

### R1D34 [December 27, Tuesday, 2021]

Etch-a-Sketch is working as expected, and some variables and functions were created to make things easier for later modifications. Still there are additional features to be added but everything is going great. This will be finished soon.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1476052285654376449)

### R1D35 [December 29, Wednesday, 2021]

Now the project is a lot more fun, but a lot more complex as well. Mostly every adjustment gives me the necessity to refactor some lines of code to make it cleaner. Though being somewhat repetitive sometimes, doing this project is exciting me. I'm building something cool aside from advancing in the curriculum, and that makes me proud.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1476441011157037056)

### R1D36 [December 30, Thursday, 2021]

Hadn't internet connecion to tweet yesterday but still did the job. Now the Etch-a-Sketch is not only black but has a variety of colors to choose from, as custom, random, rainbow and eraser mode. Just grayscale mode and the UI design is left to be done.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1476971520018817030)

### R1D37 [January 02, Sunday, 2022]

Etch-a-Sketch's UI design has actually a first finished version now. Later changes in the near future will be only to the design. I've already completed the grayscale feature on Dec 31 but somehow didn't tracked it. With the project done (and too lazy to keep curating the aesthetics for the moment), I'm ready to move on to further lessons/projects.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1477897589307723776)

### R1D38 [January 20, Thursday, 2022]

Hey! It's me again after almost three weeks of absence. Although the inconsistency, things are looking bright in the near future. I'm working with getting averages from a list of numbers with JS functions and building the UI for it. Aside from this current project, I'm taking a WordPress course to soon be starting a blog.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1484425228776210435)

### R1D39 [February 04, Friday, 2022]

Yet again... coming back. Most of my activity these days was taking courses about diverse topics and didn't focus specifically on the matter: programming. Maybe because of knowing it isn't that easy and either wasn't today. The math website I'm working on has got to calc different averages and handle some possible errors, not to mention it still hasn't got a nice user interface. Most of the today's work was getting a simple function to work and then realizing it needed further debugging. Advancing here seems slow but I hope it builds up something I'll be proud of in the future.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1489839106951634945)

### R1D40 [February 07, Monday, 2022]

Harder than I expected, but easy when you are already tackling the job. Now most of the average.js programming is done but the interquartile mean which is still pending. There's still room to refactor and curate my code too. I'm making an effort to make this website cool, so just wait to see it when times comes to design the CSS.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1490893255961354242)

### R1D41 [February 08, Tuesday, 2022]

Finally fixed the interquartile mean bug and found it it was way easier than I though before. Coming up with a fresh mind helps for sure. I've bingewatched most of the Platzi's ECMAScript 6+ course afterwards and then tried to make a fibonacci function as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript exercises repo.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1491327490400612355)

### R1D42 [February 09, Wednesday, 2022]

Solved the JavaScript exercises required for the practice before the calculator project. So tomorrow I'll start with the final Foundations's project, the calculator. Regarding courses, I've finished watching the ECMAScript 6+ one and tomorrow start with the Frontend Developer courses —all of them from Platzi— to consolidate my HTML/CSS knowledge.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1491571594661183497)

### R1D43 [February 10, Thursday, 2022]

Starting with The Odin Project's JavaScript calculator project. Going on with the Frontend Developer course as well.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1492045292077727762)

### R1D44 [February 11, Friday, 2022]

Seriously considering to read the "How to Think Like a Programmer" book. Everything was extremely smooth while building the calculator until it was time to validate the user input... There were more conditionals needed than what I would have thought at the first glance, and still I'm in the process on figuring this out—probably with spaghetti code. It's somewhat tedious but gratifying at the same time to have a challenge.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1492293638902194177)

### R1D45 [February 14, Monday, 2022]

I'm almost done validating the user inputs for the calculator, which is still somewhat spaghetti code. I've read some of "Think Like a Programmer" book as well, and I'm really liking it, so hopefully I'm leveling up my coding skills soon. Other stuff that I'm learning is the foundations of Data Science with Platzi's Datacademy challenge and basic C++ syntax to follow up with Think Like a Programmer.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1493463892969893889)

### R1D46 [February 15, Tuesday, 2022]

Still with the input validator, now making the screen's operators be replaced if a new one is clicked instead of a number. Most of the stuff works well, except for a few bugs. I'm worried that code is getting spaghettier—a long refactoring session is coming after making it work.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1493869084617883648)

### R1D47 [February 16, Wednesday, 2022]

I was nearest to the expected outcome of the calculator than I thought. I've got clarified in The Odin Project's Discord that operations must be done one after another, not respecting the operators precedence. That's for a reason, I would have got overwhelmed and not focused on other interesting stuff. Now the calculator already works except for some bugs that should be easily fixed later. Afterwards only CSS and some additional features are remaining.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1494045620092481537)

### R1D48 [February 18, Friday, 2022]

Reimagining the logic of the application. It happens that many of the stuff I thought it should be featured in the calculator it shouldn't have. Again, it's currently buggy, but still doesn't seem like too much to fix.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1494918704617988096)

### R1D49 [February 21, Monday, 2022]

My code right know is messy, but the one I commented out in order to start fresh was even worse. Probably was a productive thing to think again about the logic, so I'm more confident on what I'm doing.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1496053425712373761)

### R1D50 [February 22, Tuesday, 2022]

Maybe shouldn't say that I'm "close to finishing" anymore, every time something happens. Still, the code structure makes everything clearer, most of the stuff except a bug are working as expected, and probably fixing the bug will speed things up. There're many things left besides calculating tho, like making the CSS nice, for example. Anyways, everything is going smoother.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1496399357662351361)

### R151 [February 23, Wednesday, 2022]

Calculator is already working as expected except for some some bugs + made myself a way to debug unexpected behavior.
Added an event listener to every button which launches the debugger if something's wrong with the array I use for the operations.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1496766730596720640)

### R1D52 [February 24, Thursday, 2022]

Calculator working as expected, but it needs serious refactoring.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1497124820126949396)

### R1D53 [February 25, Friday, 2022]

Now I added a backspace button, that's all. Every once a while I run into a bug when some weird combination of buttons are pressed and have to fix it. I've learned something about JavaScript debugging tools lately out of necessity. It's still the bare basics, but still much better than to console.log everything.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1497339537399422979)

### R1D54 [February 27, Sunday, 2022]

I learned about keyboard events today and applied it to add keyboard support for the calculator project. Tweaked around some sizes and alignments with CSS too.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1498241153652736003)

### R1D55 [February 28, Monday, 2022]

Now modifying the calculator's CSS. I changed the `background-color` and `font-family` of some elements. The buttons were also rearranged to make them fix better. Overall, it looks better.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luisntapia/status/1498454262753464320)

### R1D56 [March 03, Thursday]

Yesterday I was learning about asynchronous JavaScript. Today I applied promises to build a debugging tool. I didn't understand it so much at first, but writing the pseudocode logic in paper helped a lot. It clicks buttons randomly, and when an error is produced the code pauses in Chrome Dev Tools.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luistapiaco/status/1499598323229024274)

### R1D57 [March 06, Sunday]

It wasn't coding but pseudo-coding. The calculator program's logic was messy, as stated before. It was only time needed to perform a proper refactor. Still it's not the day, but ever closer. With paper and pencil in hand I built the logic from scratch. This cleared my mind and will help me to meet more gracefully the project's constraints. As stated in the "Think Like a Programmer" book, a plan is always needed. That was what I lacked, but I'm building it now.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luistapiaco/status/1500654457335463938)

### R1D58 [March 07, Monday]

I did it. After figuring out the logic of the program on paper, now when I started coding the logic from scratch it was much cleaner than before and few bugs happened. Now most of the times the calculator works all right. It was proved another time that figuring out the algorithms is way more important than the syntax itself.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luistapiaco/status/1501072920021540866)

### R1D59 [March 08, Tuesday]

I fixed some bugs, then highlighted the selected operators, then rounded the answers to four decimal places. I'm glad to have finished it after the long struggle to build the logic of the application.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luistapiaco/status/1501477395966185475)

### R1D60 [March 09, Wednesday]

I'm resuming the math website project, now doing the CSS. I rearranged the file structure and began with a mobile-first approach.

[Today's tweet.](https://twitter.com/luistapiaco/status/1501861527699308546)

### R1D61 [April 24, Sunday]

Warming up with CodeWars challenges. Glad to code again and soon be working on my personal projects.

### R1D62 [May 01, Sunday]

Code Wars again, and I'm ranking up. It keeps getting more challenging each time.

### R1D63 [May 02, Monday]

I still haven't got up to speed with the projects I were working on, but at least this is my second consecutive day coding after a long period of time, and I'm glad about it. Following days I should be following along The Odin Project aside from doing Code Wars challenges, which anyways are a great form of putting my skills into practice.

### R1D64 [May 03, Tuesday]

The today's Code Wars challenges were related to regular expressions. I like to use them, but they need to be practiced. Probably next days I'll be taking custom challenges to master them.
