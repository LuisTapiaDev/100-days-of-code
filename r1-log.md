# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Lou]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Thursday, 2021].

I'll be following the Full Stack JavaScript path from The Odin Project, and completing the FreeCodeCamp certification projects as well.
Furtheraway I'll be moving on to blockchain development, and any technology that fits my needs.

## Log

### R1D1 [October 14, Thursday, 2021]

Continued with The Odin Project's landing page project, which is sushi themed. Since I did the HTML structure yesterday, today I focused on tuning up the hero section.

### R1D4 [October 17, Sunday, 2021]

Now as the [sushi landing page](https://github.com/doggelou/sushi-landing-page) is done, I'm moving on to the JavaScript section of Foundations. While reading the lessons, I'm working on FreeCodeCamp's tribute page html/css project so I'm actually coding aside from the tutorials.

### R1D5 [October 18, Monday, 2021]

Not great visual changes today, but I'm almost done cloning the FreeCodeCamp's mobile reference page for building the project. Next steps are adapting for desktop and then customizing the content and additional CSS to make it look nicer.

### R1D6 [October 19, Tuesday, 2021]

Tweaked a few things and added media queries for resembling the FreeCodeCamp's example page. Now I'm adding my own content and style, beginning with the Marcus Aurelius image and placeholder text.
