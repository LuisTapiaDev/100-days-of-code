# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Lou]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Thursday, 2021].

I'll be following the Full Stack JavaScript path from The Odin Project, and completing the FreeCodeCamp certification projects as well.
Furtheraway I'll be moving on to blockchain development, and any technology that fits my needs.

## Log

### R1D1 [October 14, Thursday, 2021]

Continued with The Odin Project's landing page project, which is sushi themed. Since I did the HTML structure yesterday, today I focused on tuning up the hero section.

### R1D3 [October 16, Saturday, 2021]

Sushi landing page is completed! Still not responsive for mobile but it will be done later. Moving on to further lessons and projects!

### R1D4 [October 17, Sunday, 2021]

Now as the [sushi landing page](https://github.com/doggelou/sushi-landing-page) is done, I'm moving on to the JavaScript section of Foundations. While reading the lessons, I'm working on FreeCodeCamp's tribute page html/css project so I'm actually coding aside from the tutorials.

### R1D5 [October 18, Monday, 2021]

Not great visual changes today, but I'm almost done cloning the FreeCodeCamp's mobile reference page for building the project. Next steps are adapting for desktop and then customizing the content and additional CSS to make it look nicer.

### R1D6 [October 19, Tuesday, 2021]

Tweaked a few things and added media queries for resembling the FreeCodeCamp's example page. Now I'm adding my own content and style, beginning with the Marcus Aurelius image and placeholder text.

### R1D7 [October 20, Wednesday, 2021]

Almost done with the project. Changed the display, colors, and background of the website. Only a few more styles and the timeline/quote content remaining.

### R1D8 [October 21, Thursday, 2021]

The [tribute page](https://github.com/doggelou/tribute-page) is finally done. It took a while but it's worth the results. Probably React stuff will be added later as I advance with The Odin Project's JavaScript path, but it's fine for now.

### R1D9 [October 23, Saturday, 2021]

I couldn't commit here yesterday. I did try to do it and made the GitHub repo, but was too sleepy to complete the 1-hour daily challenge. Today I'm continuing with the freeCodeCamp's survey form project. The html is already done and passed all the tests. So, tomorrow will be meant to make the project look beautiful.

### R1D10 [October 24, Sunday, 2021]

I made an image background for the form and applied a few media queries to make the webpage responsive. I'm pretty close to finish this one, and mostly what's remaining is styling the fonts and form elements. Will probably personalize the form info later. On the other side, I'm taking steps to get to The Odin Project's JS calculator ASAP, so the fun begins!

### R1D11 [October 25, Monday, 2021]

Styling form elements isn't as straightforward as I thought but I'm pretty much done with that. It already looks cool, further details would be refining the stuff. CSS has been kinda tricky so far, and some seemingly simple things actually take its time to figure it out. Still looking forward to JS.

### R1D12 [October 26, Tuesday, 2021]

I haven't coded with python after a while, but it's my first programming language -from which I've learned the syntax, at least. I've returned to it today while completing the freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Certification's arithmetic formatter project. Though the time I've been around with it, my knowledge is still within the basic syntax, and the project seems challenging, so I'm happy with it.

### R1D13 [October 27, Wednesday, 2021]

Python program is taking shape. It now prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator. I handles exceptions very well, and displays all the operations results either when it reaches a max of 5 or when the user tells so. Still, it needs to format the results and get input by means of a function, but the core is already there.

### R1D14 [October 28, Thursday, 2021]

I'm working on the arithmetic_arranger function. It does the job: returns an arranged problem. The only minor issue are a few times when the formatter doesn't add an extra space between operator and operand. Still, that needs to be adapted to other project's requites but it's going alright.

### R1D15 [November 01, Monday, 2021]

I continued with the Python arithmetic formatter project, where found the bug it had and fixed it. Most of your development time is actually reading code rather than typing, they say; It's making a whole lot of sense now, even with a simple project.

### R1D16 [November 02, Tuesday, 2021]

Closer to a final app. It arranges the problems correctly. Somehow doesn't pass the freeCodeCamp tests on Replit but I'll figure it out tomorrow. Aside from it, I must clean the code as well. As an advice from tweet reply I received, it would be useful to search about declarative vs imperative programming in order to make my code more readable. Surely will check that later.
