# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Lou]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 14, Thursday, 2021].

I'll be following the Full Stack JavaScript path from The Odin Project, and completing the FreeCodeCamp certification projects as well.
Furtheraway I'll be moving on to blockchain development, and any technology that fits my needs.

Continued with The Odin Project's landing page project, which is sushi themed. Since I did the HTML structure yesterday, today I focused on tuning up the hero section.
